# Real News

A port of the Real News Alexa Skill for Google Assistant that leverages the [News API](http://newsapi.org). The skill retrieves headlines across multiple sources and also lets the user request headlines from a specific source. Real News is currently only supported in the United States.


This app will try to maintain feature parity with the Alexa skill.
